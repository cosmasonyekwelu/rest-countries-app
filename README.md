# REST Countries API with Color Theme Switcher Solution

This is my solution to the [REST Countries API with Color Theme Switcher Challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca).
This project helped me build a modern, responsive web app using **React**, **Bootstrap**, and the **REST Countries API**, with light and dark mode functionality.

## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View all countries from the REST Countries API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an input field
- Filter countries by region (e.g., Africa, Europe, Asia, etc.)
- Click on a country to view detailed information on a separate page
- Navigate directly to border countries from the country detail page
- Toggle between light and dark mode
- Experience smooth transitions and responsive layouts across all devices

### Built With

### What I Learned

Through this challenge, I improved my understanding of:

- Handling **API requests** with async/await and managing loading/error states
- Structuring a **React application** using a component-based approach
- Implementing **search** and **filter** logic using state and props
- Creating a **light/dark mode system** using CSS variables and local storage
- Designing for accessibility, including keyboard focus and color contrast
- Managing **pagination** for large datasets in a responsive UI

## Final Thoughts

This project allowed me to merge **API integration**, **state management**, and **responsive design** into a cohesive web application.
It showcases my front-end workflow from clean code structure and theme management to accessibility and performance optimization.

The REST Countries App was a valuable exercise in building a user-friendly, production-ready React project with a professional design system.
